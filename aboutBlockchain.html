            <h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>
            <p>
                Blockchain is a technology that allows for the secure, transparent, and permanent recording of data and transactions across a network. It's a distributed database, meaning that the power to update the blockchain is spread out among the participants of the network.
            </p>
            <h3>Key Features of Blockchain</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Blockchains are cryptographically secure, requiring two keys to access or add data: a public key and a private key.</li>
                <li><strong>Immutability:</strong> Data on a blockchain cannot be altered without the permission of a majority of the network participants. If someone tries to alter data, all participants are notified.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Blockchains provide a single source of truth for data, eliminating duplication and increasing security.</li>
                <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Blockchains are decentralized, meaning that transactions can be confirmed without a central authority.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Applications of Blockchain</h3>
            <p>Blockchains are best known for their role in cryptocurrency systems, but they can also be used in many other areas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tracking orders and payments</li>
                <li>Supply chain tracking</li>
                <li>Fund transfers</li>
                <li>Sustainability</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Popular Cryptocurrencies</h3>
            <h4>Bitcoin (BTC)</h4>
            <p>Bitcoin is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency. It uses blockchain technology to allow peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a central authority.</p>
            <h4>Ethereum (ETH)</h4>
            <p>Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts. It also features a cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH), which powers the network.</p>
            <h4>XRP (Ripple)</h4>
            <p>XRP is the native cryptocurrency of Ripple, a blockchain-based payment network designed for fast and low-cost cross-border payments.</p>
