            <h2>Overview of Features</h2>
            <p>This Crypto Hashing project uses blockchain technology to securely record transactions and provide transparency in the supply chain. Here are some of the key features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Secure Transaction Recording:</strong> Each transaction is cryptographically hashed to ensure data integrity.</li>
                <li><strong>Immutability:</strong> Once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted without the consensus of the network.</li>
                <li><strong>Decentralized Verification:</strong> Blockchain provides a decentralized approach to verifying transactions without the need for a central authority.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Data Access:</strong> Authorized participants can access real-time information about the supply chain, ensuring transparency and traceability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Project Use Cases</h2>
            <p>This project is primarily used for demonstrating how blockchain can improve supply chain transparency and security by tracking product authenticity and lifecycle stages.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supply Chain Management:</strong> Track products from manufacturer to end user.</li>
                <li><strong>Fraud Prevention:</strong> Ensure authenticity and prevent counterfeit goods in high-value products.</li>
                <li><strong>Verification of Product Lifecycle:</strong> Track every stage of a product's journey, ensuring transparency.</li>
            </ul>
